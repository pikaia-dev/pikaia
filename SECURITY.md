# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using a public GitHub issue. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right away through a private Discord message. You can find our community at https://discord.gg/EVMsUAG6.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

We do not currently have a bounty program in place, so we cannot offer monetary rewards for any reported problems, but you will be credited as the reporter once the announcement is published.
